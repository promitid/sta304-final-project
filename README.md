## Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health in Canada

### Overview

This repo contains code and data for analysis of the 2020 COVID-19 National Survey done by the Canadian Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. The data was requested and downloaded for free from this website: https://www.delvinia.com/camh-coronavirus-mental-health/

- **Survey data**: COVID-19 National Survey Dashboard. (2020, December 1). CAMH. https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-health-and-covid-19/covid-19-national-survey 

Data Processing:

After downloading the raw data for each survey iteration in xlsx format, I decided to convert the xlsx files to csv using Google sheets since I was more familiar with the csv libraries in R, but the data can be read in either format. Using csv format made it easier for me to read the data and shorten some column names in a code editor.
